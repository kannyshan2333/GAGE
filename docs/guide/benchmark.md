# gage-eval Benchmark Guide

This document provides execution commands and detailed descriptions for benchmark configs that exist in the current `gage-eval-main/` repository.

## Common Evaluation Chain

flowchart LR
  Raw[Dataset] --> Pre[Preprocess] --> Sup[Support] --> Inf[Inference] --> Jdg[Judge] --> AE[AutoEval] --> Rep[Report]
```

## Usage Overview

Run commands assume you are in the `gage-eval-main/` repository root and use the core entry point `run.py`.

* **`--config`**: Path to the YAML configuration defining the model, prompts, and dataset parameters.
* **`--output-dir`**: Where logs and results are stored.
* **`--run-id`**: Unique identifier for the specific evaluation run.

## Supported Backend Engines

The framework supports multiple inference backends to ensure flexibility across different environments. Currently supported engines include, but are not limited to:

* **vLLM**: Optimized for high-throughput serving of local models.
* **LiteLLM**: A unified interface for calling various external LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

To switch between backends, modify the `backend_id` parameter within the `role_adapters` section of your specific benchmark YAML file:

```yaml
role_adapters:
  - adapter_id: dut_mmlu_pro_vllm_qwen
    role_type: dut_model
    backend_id: "vllm"  # Options: vllm, litellm, etc.
```
If you need a full evaluation, adjust `max_samples`/`limit`.

### AMO-Bench
AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems. Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation.

AMO-Bench uses different evaluation methods based on answer_type:
- **description**: Uses LLM judge for semantic comparison
- **number/set**: Uses math_verify parser for mathematical equivalence
- **variable**: Uses try_list with sympy solver for function verification

#### Execution Command

  --output-dir ./gage_runs/final_test \

### BeyondAIME
BeyondAIME is a curated test set designed to benchmark advanced mathematical reasoning. Its creation was guided by the following core principles to ensure a fair and challenging evaluation:

* **High Difficulty**: Problems are sourced from high-school and university mathematics competitions, with a difficulty level greater than or equal to that of AIME Problems #11-15.
* **Contamination-Resistant**: Every problem has been manually revised to be unique, ensuring it will not be found in standard pre-training corpora and providing a true test of a model's reasoning abilities.
* **Focus on Reasoning, Not Knowledge**: The dataset exclusively tests reasoning by ensuring that problems do not require mathematical knowledge beyond the standard university level.
* **Robust Problem Design**: The dataset avoids "pseudo-proof" problems. For problems requiring proof-like steps, they have been reformulated so that guessing the answer is as difficult as formally solving the problem.
* **Automated & Accurate Evaluation**: Each problem's answer is a positive integer, allowing for an unambiguous and 100% accurate automated verification of model performance.

```bash
python GAGE/run.py \

### ForecastBench (static)

ForecastBench can run as a **fully static** GAGE evaluation: paired `question_set` + `resolution_set` JSON files are joined by `id` in the `forecastbench` loader, converted to `Sample` objects by the `forecastbench_static` preprocessor, scored with the rule metric `forecastbench_probability`, and aggregated with `forecastbench_probability_summary`. P0 keeps **resolved Polymarket market** rows only (`source_filter`, `resolved_only`). Paths are read from dataset `params` (`question_set_path`, `resolution_set_path`); `hub: inline` is only a placeholder and does not supply the JSON paths.

#### Execution command (full)

```bash
python run.py \
  --config config/custom/forecastbench/polymarket_static_full.yaml \
  --output-dir ./gage_runs/forecastbench_full \
  --run-id forecastbench_full
```

For a full run, point `FORECASTBENCH_QUESTION_SET_PATH` / `FORECASTBENCH_RESOLUTION_SET_PATH` at real ForecastBench exports. The bundled files under `tests/fixtures/forecastbench/` are only for unit tests and quick pipeline checks. See `docs/forecastbench/README.md` for the integration guide.
